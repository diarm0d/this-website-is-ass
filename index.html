      <h2>Welcome to A.S.S.</h2>
      <p>You think slapping an aria-label on a button makes you some kind of fucking accessibility hero? You think your skip link
      that only appears on hover deserves a pat on the back from the W3C? You think your 15MB full-screen autoplay video with
      white text on a cloudy background is "inclusive design"?</p>
      
      <b>Wrong, motherfucker.</b>
      
      <p></p>Let me show you what a real A.S.S. looks like; Accessible. Super. Semantic. A site that doesn&apos;t send screen readers
      into cardiac arrest or trap keyboard users in modal purgatory. A site where every alt tag means something, every heading
      actually describes something, and no one has to click a hidden hamburger menu just to find the fucking ‚ÄúContact‚Äù page:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>No hover-only dropdowns</li>
        <li>No animations that trigger seizures</li>
        <li>No JavaScript breakage</li>
        <li>Just plain semantic HTML</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>1. Alt Text or Alt Death</h2>
      <p>You uploaded 48 images of your flat white and not a single one has alt text. Are your visuals that empty
        <em>and</em> that meaningless? Without alt, your image is just a black hole of silence to anyone not blessed with
        20/20 vision and high-speed Wi-Fi.</p>
    
      <p>Here's what you did:</p>
      <pre><code>&lt;img src="hipster-coffee.jpg"&gt;</code></pre>
        
      <p>And if you really went the extra mile; you gave it an alt like this:</p>
      <pre><code>&lt;img src="hipster-coffee.jpg" alt="hipster-coffee."&gt;</code></pre>
      
      <p>Congratulations; you just described literally <strong>nothing</strong>. That's not alt text; that's a file name with
        a period. You think a screen reader user wants to hear ‚Äúhipster dash coffee dot jpg‚Äù while navigating your artisan
        soap blog?</p>

      <p>Here's what you <strong>should</strong> have done; it's not that hard:</p>
      <pre><code>&lt;img src="hipster-coffee.jpg" alt="A barista pouring a perfect flat white with a fern leaf latte art"&gt;</code></pre>
    
      <p>See that? A little bit of text, a whole lot of dignity. If the image means something, describe it. If it's
        decorative, slap <code>alt=""</code> on it and move on with your life. But don't you dare leave it blank unless
        you're doing it <em>on purpose</em>.</p>
    
      <p>This is A.S.S. - Accessibility. Seriously. Slaps. So yes; even our cat memes have alt text.</p>

      <h2>2. Contrast, You Colorblind Clown</h2>
    
      <p>Your site‚Äôs got more pastel than a toddler‚Äôs birthday party and less contrast than a Twilight fanfic. Hope your
        users brought binoculars and a flashlight. Your text looks like it‚Äôs playing hide-and-seek with the background.</p>
    
      <p>Here‚Äôs what you shipped:</p>
      <div style="background-color: #ffffff; padding: 1rem;">
        <p style="color: #cccccc;">This is your amazing ‚Äúcontent‚Äù. Isn‚Äôt it just dreamy?</p>
      </div>
    
      <p>1; It fails WCAG. 2; It fails users. 3; It fails as a basic act of human decency.</p>
    
      <p>Here‚Äôs what you <strong>should</strong> have done:</p>
      <div style="background-color: #ffffff; padding: 1rem;">
        <p style="color: #000000;">This is your content. And look at that; it‚Äôs actually readable.</p>
      </div>
    
      <p>Need a rule? Here it is: <strong>minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio for body text</strong>. That‚Äôs not a suggestion;
        that‚Äôs the baseline. If you want to go AAA; make it 7:1 and ascend to accessibility nirvana.</p>

      <p>Want to double‚Äëcheck your colors before shipping? Use a tool like <a href="https://colourcontrast.cc/">Colour
          Contrast Checker</a> to test background and foreground pairs in real time against WCAG AA/AAA standards; it‚Äôs one of
        the easiest ways to stop forcing users to squint.</p>
    
      <p>This is A.S.S. ‚Äì Accessibility. Seriously. Slaps. And we don‚Äôt let users squint like they‚Äôre trying to read through
        fog.</p>

      <h2>3. Tab Me Like One of Your French Girls</h2>
    
      <p>You built the Mona Lisa of landing pages; the gradient is tasteful; the buttons have shadows; and your modal pops
        like champagne on launch day. But try hitting Tab and suddenly the whole thing collapses like a flan in a cupboard.
      </p>
    
      <p>Focus is jumping around like it‚Äôs on acid; half your elements aren‚Äôt focusable; and that lovingly crafted CTA? It‚Äôs
        a goddamn div with a click handler. Nobody told you about <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> or <code>tabindex</code>; and
        clearly nobody told your keyboard‚Äëonly users they mattered.</p>
    
      <p>You know what's hot? Sequential; predictable; tabbing. You know what's hotter? A visible focus state; like a
        glowing halo of usability wrapped around your interactive elements. It's not just sexy; it's survivable.</p>
    
      <p>Here‚Äôs what you shipped:</p>
      <div style="padding: 1rem; border: 1px solid #ccc;">
        <div onClick="alert('Congrats, you clicked a div. Too bad no one using a keyboard ever will.')"" style="padding: 0.5rem; background: #eee; cursor: pointer; width: fit-content;">Click Me (if you can find me)
        </div>
      </div>
    
      <p>And here‚Äôs what you should have shipped:</p>
      <div style="padding: 1rem; border: 1px solid #ccc;">
        <button onclick="alert('Bless you; you used a real &lt;button&gt;. The keyboard users send their regards.')" style="padding: 0.5rem;">Click Me (any way you like)</button>
      </div>
    
      <p>If your site‚Äôs not usable with just a keyboard; it‚Äôs not usable. Period. Tabbing through your site should feel like
        a Wes Anderson tracking shot; smooth; linear; intentional. Not like skipping through a PowerPoint made by a drunk
        raccoon.</p>
    
      <p>Rule of A.S.S.; if it can be clicked; it should be focusable. If it can be focused; it should be visible. And if
        you hide focus rings; you're hiding from responsibility.</p>

      <h2>4. Skip Links, Not Users</h2>
    
      <p>Oh, your site has a skip link? Cute. Too bad it‚Äôs hidden behind 17 lines of CSS and only appears if you recite the
        Konami code. Visibility on focus isn‚Äôt just a suggestion; it's your one shot at not being a design sociopath.</p>
    
      <p>Skip links aren‚Äôt optional; they‚Äôre the doorman to your website's content. Without one; screen reader and keyboard
        users are left tapping through your 40-item nav bar like it‚Äôs some sadistic side quest. Accessibility is not the
        place for Easter eggs.</p>
    
      <p>Here‚Äôs what your skip link should look like:</p>
    
      <pre><code>&lt;a href="#main-content" class="skip-link"&gt;Skip to main content&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
    
      <p>And yes; it should actually be visible when focused:</p>
    
      <style>
        .skip-link {
          position: absolute;
          top: -40px;
          left: 0;
          background: black;
          color: white;
          padding: 8px 16px;
          z-index: 100;
          text-decoration: none;
        }
    
        .skip-link:focus {
          top: 0;
        }
      </style>
    
      <a href="#main-content" class="skip-link">Skip to main content</a>
    
      <p>Stick it just after the opening <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>. Give it real contrast. Let it live its best life. Your
        users will thank you ‚Äî or at least they‚Äôll stop cursing your name.</p>
    
      <p>Because nothing says ‚ÄúI care‚Äù like letting someone <em>skip your 9-column, 3-tier, fully animated navigation
          clusterfuck</em> and just get to the damn content.</p>

      <h2>5. Headings, Hierarchy, and Hella Confusion</h2>
    
      <p>You‚Äôve got 12 <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s and not a single heading in sight. You use <code>&lt;h4&gt;</code> before
        <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> like your content was organized by a feral cat on a Red Bull bender. Assistive tech isn‚Äôt
        psychic ‚Äî give it a goddamn roadmap.</p>
    
      <p>Headings aren‚Äôt decorative; they‚Äôre structural. Screen readers rely on them like lost hikers rely on trail markers.
        When you go straight from <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> and then back to
        <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, you‚Äôre not edgy ‚Äî you‚Äôre chaos incarnate.</p>
    
      <p>Let‚Äôs break this down like grown-ups:</p>
    
      <pre><code>&lt;h1&gt;Main Page Title&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Section Heading&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;Subsection Heading&lt;/h3&gt;</code></pre>
    
      <p>Simple. Hierarchical. Understandable. You wouldn‚Äôt write an essay with the conclusion at the top and the intro
        buried in footnotes ‚Äî so don‚Äôt code your site like that.</p>
    
      <p>And no ‚Äî <strong>styling your <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> to "look like" a heading</strong> doesn‚Äôt make it one. Your
        CSS can lie to your eyes, but it can‚Äôt fool a screen reader. That‚Äôs like putting a wig on a chair and calling it
        grandma.</p>
    
      <p>If your headings don‚Äôt follow a logical order; you're not building a site ‚Äî you're building a semantic dumpster
        fire.</p>
